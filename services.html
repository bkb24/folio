<div class="serives-section services-new-site">
        <h3>Creating new website</h3>

        <p>
            Your are a small, medium or larger business but you don't have a website
            or maybe it is too old and not updated in years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Or you are an artist that doesn't have any coding or website development experience.
            But you need a portfolio to show your work and potentially get new clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            Or maybe you have that project that you sweared you were going to make one day
            but never started it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can make you a clean looking website like this one or something
            that you have in mind. Depending on your specific needs we will decide
            how to make and manage it.
        </p>

        <h4>Wordpress</h4>

        <p>
            For most people the simple solution could just a WordPress site
            with a custom or a generic theme with a built-in blog.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that approach we can save time and you can save money since
            hand coding may not be neccessary at all.
        </p>

        <h5>Custom coded website</h5>

        <p>
            Some people do not like WordPress, it's understandable. Some don't like their approach,
            some just want it to be less complicated when they a landingpage-like site. I can definately do
            that for you. And of course for very specific and complex projects WordPress is often not a very flexible
            and maintainable solution. So for any project like that please contact me to discuss
            how we are going to approach it.
        </p>

        <h5>Static website with minimal future changes / GatsbyJs</h5>

        <p>
            We are talking about a website like a landing page as te example given above.
            The cool thing about websites like that is that nowadays you won't need to pay for hosting services.
            We are going to make the site and upload it on a platform like Netlify.
            Another cool thing is NetlifyCMS plus GatsbyJs. With those we can even make you a more complex site
            with database, or a blog. And you will still not need to pay for hosting.
        </p>

    <div class="serives-section services-store">
        <h3>Online store or a catalogue</h3>

        <p>
            You have products for sale and you have found out the brick and mortar stores
            can't quite compete with online shopping. You have heard many stories how
            people are making money from online stores and that everybody is selling
            everything but their underwear online.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can set up a WooCommerce store or make a custom one if you will.
            WooCommerce is a very popular tool used for creating an online store.
            It is powered by WordPress, so if you are familiar with it then you know what to expect.
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned before, WordPress is not everybodys cup of tea and I get that.
            We can make you your own custom coded store or use other store management
            systems like OpenCart or Magento.
        </p>

    <div class="serives-section services-development">
        <h3>Application development, API, integrations, etc</h3>

        <p>
            I have been a part of the development team of ucha.se - one of the most popular Bulgarian learning patforms.
            As a full stack PHP developer there for 3 years, I worked on their in-house built MVC framework amd ORM
            and on a plethora of different modules and functionalities and designs.
        </p>

        <p>
            So one thing I can do for you is developing a module for your application
            when you don't need an entire team.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another is building an API you want with database like MySQL/MariaDB or MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of my experience on the back end is with PHP but also have experience with NodeJs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also reach me when needing a fix on a specific browser, or some design corrections or maybe
            implementing a new design.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="serives-section services-design">
        <h3>Web design</h3>

        <p>
            Now I am not a graphic designer, I can't draw and I don't have a beautiful imagination when it comes to design.
            Still you can expect a clean simple design for your websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another thing we can do is translating your already made design to a fully functioning webpage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ask me about your design requirements, if we don't think I can do it, I can
            recommend a great designer to do that instead.
        </p>

    <div class="serives-section services-management">
        <h3>Hosting and server management</h3>

        <h5>Hosting</h5>

        <p>
            In some cases like with the static website you won't need to bother with dealing
            with hosting companies. But in most cases you will need a space online to keep your site up
            and running 24/7. Now you can have your own hosting account and I
            will just upload my work there and we are fine. But if you don't want to deal any ot that
            I can take care of it. It would be more expensive for you but you wouldn't need to do
            anything, it will be my job to pay for the hosting and manage it.
        </p>

        <h5>Management</h5>

        <p>
            This includes setting up database and site backups, updating plugins
            and themes for WordPress, regularly looking up at logs and monitoring strange
            activities on your sites.
        </p>

    <div class="serives-section services-seo">
        <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>

        <p>
            Every business could use Search Engine Optimization. Now I am not a professional definately,
            but can help you with basic on-page/code SEOand local SEO.
        </p>

        <p>
            For WordPress sites I use the most popular SEO plugin - Yoast. With it you can customize
            how your pages titles and descriptions would look in the search results.
        </p>

        <p>
            For your local business we will create GoogleMyBusiness account so you are visible on GoogleMaps
            as legitimate business. We will put all relevant information about the store or your service
            on your website and choose appropriate keyphrases to be able to compete with others in your niche.
            So when people living in your area search for keyphrases relevant to your business,
            you are included in the results, hopefully on top.
