  Pawn shop catalog website built with WordPress and Woocommerce. I made a child
  theme from Storefront theme and some widgets. The owners wanted a quick
  website because they wanted to keep track with what products they have. Also
  they wanted to show up on Google search but without paying for SEO services
  and advertisement. So I did some research in their niche in Varna, their city,
  and did some local SEO. 3 months after release of the site they were on first
  page on the search for the term "pawn shop Varna" and it also showed up for
  "pawn shop" for searches from Varna. Not only that they were rated first or on
  first page here and there for products terms like "pawn shop TVs".
