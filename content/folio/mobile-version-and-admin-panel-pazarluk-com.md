title: Pazarluk.com - mobile version and admin panel
short: >-
  Pazarluk is an online marketplace type website (like OLX or ebay without the
  auction part). I was hired by the team of Pazarluk.com to work on their new
  mobile web application. My job included building the entire mobile front-end,
  but also some API work and other business logic on the backend. They asked me
  to work on the admin panel and try to improve the loading of some pages. We
  ended up reworking almost the entire admin panel
