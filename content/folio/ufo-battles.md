description: >-
  A real-time turn based quiz game. It is still in development and the demo site
  is closed down for now unfortunately. Here users sign up or not, find friends
  and play question games against one another. The first game is a one on one
  duel game. The idea is if the project grows to be used for education with its
  gaming / entertainment value.
