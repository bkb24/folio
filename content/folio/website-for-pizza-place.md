description: >-
  Wordpress, Woocommerce and Elementor Builder pizza website. I needed to make a
  custom template for the menu and category pages, also some customization in
  the Woocommerce products admin area. The url is from the test page, the
  website did not get live and is underdeveloped. The owner wanted to go a
  different direction.
